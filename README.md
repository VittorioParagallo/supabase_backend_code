# supabase_backend_code

In this repository i share the code i developed for my own app. I develop in flutter and I'm migrating from firebase to supabase.
In supabase there are some features missing expecially with the dart/flutter sdk and the auth client. So i wrote the functions i needed to handle my use cases. the code can be executed in the sql editor of the supabase admin panel.

Be aware this code reflect the design of a use case in which the users don't sign up by themeselves but there is somebody creating accounts. Immagine a workplace, users don't sign in, they just get an account from a sys admin.
